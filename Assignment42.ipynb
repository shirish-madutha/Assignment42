    "OLS Regression: OLS estimates coefficients that fit the data as closely as possible, without considering their \n",

    "Linearity: The relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable should be linear. Ridge\n",
    "Regression, like OLS regression, assumes that the relationship can be adequately described by a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. This assumption ensures that\n",
    "the errors of one observation do not provide information about the errors of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variability of the errors (residuals) should be constant across all levels of the predictor\n",

    "predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity Consideration: Ridge Regression is specifically used when multicollinearity is present in the \n",
    "dataset. It addresses the issue of high correlation between predictor variables, which can lead to instability in\n",
    "coefficient estimates in OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Errors: Ridge Regression does not require the normality assumption for the predictor variables or the\n",
    "response variable. However, it assumes that the errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Perfect Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity, meaning that no\n",
    "linear combination of predictor variables is an exact constant.\n",

    "No Outliers: While Ridge Regression is more robust to outliers compared to OLS regression, extreme outliers can \n",

    "It's important to note that while Ridge Regression is more forgiving in terms of assumptions compared to OLS \n",

    "Selecting the appropriate value of the tuning parameter (lambda, often denoted as Î±) in Ridge Regression is crucial \n",

    "\n",
    "Grid Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a grid search approach, you define a range of lambda values and evaluate the model's performance using a \n",

    "The lambda that yields the best performance metric (such as cross-validated RMSE or MAE) is selected as the \n",
    "optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation involves dividing the training data into multiple folds or subsets. You train the model on \n",
    "different combinations of training and validation sets and evaluate performance metrics for each fold.\n",
    "You can perform cross-validation for a range of lambda values and choose the one that provides the best trade-off\n",
    "between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation with Learning Curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves plotting the model's performance metric (e.g., RMSE) against different lambda values using \n",
    "cross-validation.\n",
    "You can observe how the performance changes as lambda increases or decreases. The optimal lambda is often where \n",
    "the performance stabilizes or starts to degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization paths show how the coefficients change with varying values of lambda.\n",
    "Plotting the regularization path helps you understand which coefficients are being shrunk and to what extent for\n",
    "different lambda values. This can guide you in selecting an appropriate lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), \n",
    "can be used to select lambda.\n",
    "These criteria balance model fit and complexity, helping you choose a lambda that optimally balances the trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also split your training data into a smaller validation set and directly evaluate different lambda values\n",
